        <h2>Hi, my name is Mike. ðŸ‘‹</h2>
        <p>I&apos;m an iOS developer that started my journey with GLP-1 in early 2025. In that time, I tried a lot of different apps to track my weight, symptoms, and general mood. None of them did what I wanted so in a weekend I built the first version of MyGLP.</p>
        <p>At the same time, I left my day job in tech to persue my dream of being an independent software developer doing what I love to do most: build apps that make lives better.</p>
        <p>I launched MyGLP mid-2025 and I&apos;m excited to continue improving it for me and everyone who finds it useful. Hopefully you do too.</p>
