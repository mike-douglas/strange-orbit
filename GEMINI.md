# Project: Landing Page for MyGLP

## Context

The MyGLP landing page will live in src/app/myglp and will be accessible at /myglp on the web.

## Code Guidelines

- You will write everything in TypeScript with NextJS, using functional programming when possible.
- There will be NO styling or CSS right now. The only styling that will be used will be for layout.
- The styles are not global to the entire app, they should all live in the src/app/myglp part of the app.
- Use a basic CSS reset with a grid. Set up typography to use Apple's SF Pro Display font with proper fallbacks.
- The app will use components with CSS modules to properly separate portions of the site and make it more maintanable.
